👋 Hi, I’m Nikita

I’m a frontend-focused full-stack developer with experience in enterprise systems, personal projects, and teaching web development fundamentals.
After a period focused on education and project work, I’m actively returning to hands-on commercial development.

My main focus is frontend engineering (Svelte, TypeScript), with a solid understanding of backend concepts (Node.js / NestJS), application architecture, and deployment.

🧠 Core skills

Frontend: Svelte, React, Vue, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS / SCSS, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, NestJS, Prisma

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB

DevOps: Docker, NGINX, Linux, HTTPS / SSL

Testing & Quality: Jest, ESLint, Prettier

AI-assisted development: Prompt Engineering, Cursor, Antigraviti

I use AI tools to speed up development, refactor code, explore architectural solutions, and improve documentation — while keeping full control over technical decisions.

🚀 Selected projects

Web Order Processing Website — full-cycle web application with custom calculation logic and backend services

Blog Platform (CMS) — rich-text blogging platform, migrating from Vue 2 to Svelte

SMS → Telegram App — React Native application for filtering and forwarding SMS messages

🎓 Background

Enterprise web systems development

Teaching web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frontend frameworks)

Strong focus on clean, maintainable code and accessibility

📌 Current goals

Return to commercial development in a team environment

Junior+ / early-middle frontend or full-stack roles

Remote work, with possible relocation in the future
